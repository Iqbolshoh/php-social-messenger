# PHP Social Messenger

PHP Social Messenger is a real-time messaging application that allows users to chat with each other, edit their profiles, and manage contacts. It provides an easy-to-use interface for sending and receiving messages, managing user profiles, and handling blocked users. The app is built using PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript (AJAX), with a focus on real-time interactions. This application also includes a RESTful API for seamless integration with other services.

## Features

### 1. Real-Time Messaging
   - Instant message updates: Messages are instantly displayed when received. The chat automatically refreshes every few seconds.
   - Message status: Shows which user sent the last message and the number of unread messages.
   - Delete or copy own messages: Users can edit, delete, or copy their own messages, but they cannot edit messages from other users.

### 2. Profile Management
   - Profile Editing: Users can update their profile picture, full name, and password directly from the user interface.
   - View Profile: Clicking on the "View Profile" option lets users see the profile information of the person they are chatting with.

### 3. Contact Search
   - Search Contacts: Users can search for contacts using the search bar on the homepage (index.php). It dynamically filters the contacts list based on the search term.
   - Manage Contacts: The app displays all the contacts on the main page, including unread messages, allowing users to stay updated.

### 4. Block Users
   - Block Functionality: Users can block others from sending messages. If you block someone, they will not be able to send you messages anymore, and you will not be able to message them.
   - Blocked Notifications: If a user tries to message someone who has blocked them, they will be notified that they are blocked.
   - Block Menu: The block option is easily accessible via the action menu in the chat interface.

### 5. Chat Interface
   - Message History: When entering a chat (chat.php), the complete message history with the other user is shown.
   - Message Actions: Users can delete or copy their own messages, while messages from others cannot be edited.
   - Real-Time Syncing: The chat updates in real-time, ensuring the user always sees the most recent messages.

   - Clear Chat: Clear the entire chat history with a specific user.
   - Block User: Block the user to prevent them from sending you any more messages.
